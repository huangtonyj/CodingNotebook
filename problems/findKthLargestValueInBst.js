/*
  Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a positive
  integer k and returns the kth largest integer contained in the
  BST.

  You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that
  k is less than or equal to the number of nodes in the tree.

  Also, for the purpose of this question, duplicate integers will be treated as
  distinct values. In other words, the second largest value in a BST containing
  values {5, 7, 7} will be 7â€”not 5.

  Each BST node has an integer value, a
  left child node, and a right child node. A node is
  said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST
  property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every
  node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values
  of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid
  BST nodes themselves or None / null.

  Sample Input
    tree =   15
          /           5      20
        /      /      2     5 17   22
    /            
    1     3       
    k = 3

  Sample Output
    17

class BST {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function findKthLargestValueInBst(tree, k) {
	if (!tree) return {size: 0};
  
	const right = findKthLargestValueInBst(tree.right, k);
	
	if (Number.isInteger(right)) return right;
	
	if (right.size + 1 === k) return tree.value;
	
	const left = findKthLargestValueInBst(tree.left, k - right.size - 1);
	
	if (Number.isInteger(left)) return left;
	
	return {size: 1 + right.size + left.size};
}

/*
  1)  Recursively check right tree
  2)  Eventually it will hit the edge and return the size
      If the diff between right.size and k is 1, that means it is the current node.
      If the there is left, check left and k - right.size - current node 1
